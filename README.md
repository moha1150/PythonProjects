# PythonProjects
A collection of scripts using the Selenium library to automate tasks such as making API calls, performing drag-and-drop actions, opening and interacting with a web browser, and searching for information on the internet.

BasicApiCalls: This project is a script that makes an API call to the UPCitemDB API to retrieve information about a product using its UPC code. The script then prints the category and brand of the product.

DragandDrop: This project is a script that uses Selenium to open a webpage that demonstrates drag-and-drop functionality, and then uses the ActionChains class to perform a drag-and-drop action on the webpage.

Interactions: This project is a script that uses Selenium to open Google Earth in a Chrome browser and then clicks the "Launch Earth" button.

WebBrowsing: This project is a script that uses Selenium to open the Google homepage in a Chrome browser, search for the "quote of the day," and submit the search form. If the search field is not found on the Google homepage, the script prints an error message and exits.
